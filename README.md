Regression Observational Studies Stats and Supervised Learning

In this homework, you will work with two popular frameworks: (1) *[sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)* (short for scikit-learn) and (2) *[statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/)*. In addition, you will create some basic visualizations to explain your findings. Regression analysis and Supervised learning constitute the two quintessential skills for a data scientist, thereby serving as the perfect material to prepare you for the real world.

The homework consists of eight tasks, which are described in the `hw2.ipynb` notebook.

For each task, please provide *both* a written explanation of the steps you followed, and the corresponding code. Keep in mind that writing the explanation can help you in two ways:1. Clarifying the steps in your mind before writing the actual code2. Earning you points if the description is correct, regardless of the potential issues in your code
